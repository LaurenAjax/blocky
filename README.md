commit 173d1c63a9be69b26c9c0d4a3f22eb60af104dc2 (HEAD -> main)
Author: ajaxlaur <ajaxlaur@132.161.196.207>
Date:   Sun Feb 9 19:13:24 2025 -0600

    Adjusted range of isValidPosition to be contained within board (well.length 
    - 4). Changed deleteRow to move downward by making the row for loop be 
    n >= row >0 and and switched the locations of its for statements.

    Adjusted spawnpoint to start at valid location (Board Height - 19). Altered 
    gravity to move downward by setting nextPos in processGravity to add 1 not 
    -1.
